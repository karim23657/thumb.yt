# thumb.yt
_Using Cloudflare Workers for easy deployment with low maintance._

thumb.yt allows you get the animated thumbnail of a YouTube video, quick and easy!  
_If the animated thumbnail could not be found we fallback to a non animated version._

### Deploying your own version
You can deploy this on Workers too! Simply change the ids and route in wrangler.toml and use Cloudflare's `wrangler publish` to deploy it or `wrangler dev` to try it out.

### Contributing
Any contributions that help make this tool better or more stable are always welcome. :heart:
